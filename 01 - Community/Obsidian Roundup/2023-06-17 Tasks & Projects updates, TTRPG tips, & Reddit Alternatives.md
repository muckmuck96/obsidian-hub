# 2023-06-17: Tasks & Projects updates, TTRPG tips, & Reddit Alternatives
Insights into productivity & society, tools for academic compiling, and new password protection options.

## Community

* Some folks put together an alternative to the Reddit community on [Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/c/obsidianmd?ref=eleanorkonik.com), which uses fediverse technology similarly to mastodon's [pkm.social](https://pkm.social/?ref=eleanorkonik.com).

## Plugins

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

__Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat?ref=eleanorkonik.com). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review.__

__If you want a comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by Ganessh Kumar.__

* [Another Quick Switcher 8.13.0](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-another-quick-switcher/releases/tag/8.13.0?ref=eleanorkonik.com) includes a new "Grep > Extensions" setting.

* [Advanced Paste v2.5.0](https://github.com/kxxt/obsidian-advanced-paste/releases/tag/2.5.0?ref=eleanorkonik.com) switched to `mime` for compatibility with Obsidian mobile. Note that this is a minor breaking change requiring updates to custom transforms.

The plugin has also improved its error handling system.
* [Tasks plugin v4.0.0](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/releases/tag/4.0.0?ref=eleanorkonik.com) added custom grouping and fixed the order of urgency groups, now putting the most urgent tasks first.

* [Novel Word Count v2.17.1](https://github.com/isaaclyman/novel-word-count-obsidian/releases?ref=eleanorkonik.com) no longer includes frontmatter in the wordcounts.

## Appearance

* [Oozy](https://github.com/zaklezaja/obsidian-oozy?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@zaklezaja` evokes the green ooze popular in the '90s.
* [Origin](https://github.com/Bluemoondragon07/Obsidian-Origin?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@Bluemoondragon07` mimics the design of pre-v1.0.0 Obsidian.
* [Indent headings v0.3](https://github.com/zamsyt/obsidian-snippets/wiki/Indent-headings?ref=eleanorkonik.com) fixed a serious performance issue that was causing a slowdown of the Community plugins browser.

## Guides

* Here's a centralized documentation site for [javalent's plugins](https://plugins.javalent.com/home?ref=eleanorkonik.com), which include admonitions, image window, dice roller, fantasy statblocks, leaflet, and more.
* Here's a nice explanation of how [Obsidian Copilot](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/obsidian-copilot/?ref=eleanorkonik.com) works, particularly for folks with a strong daily notes practice.
* Here's a fairly comprehensive set of [tutorials for TTRPG users](https://obsidianttrpgtutorials.com/Obsidian+TTRPG+Tutorials/Obsidian+TTRPG+Tutorials?ref=eleanorkonik.com).

## Food For Thought

* Cal Newport had a really insightful piece [on the slow productivity of John Wick](https://calnewport.com/on-the-slow-productivity-of-john-wick/?ref=eleanorkonik.com) and how white collar office work optimizes for a different kind of productivity than the arts.
* Here are some thoughts I found compelling about [the difficulty of making a "good" social media site](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/stop-trying-to-make-a-good-social?ref=eleanorkonik.com).

## Ancillary Tools

* [Gtree](https://ddddddo.github.io/gtree/?ref=eleanorkonik.com) lets users turn a markdown list into a visual directory tree.
* Here's a set of [pandoc templates for academics](https://github.com/universvm/obsidian-pandoc-templates?ref=eleanorkonik.com) to use with Obsidian.
