# 2023-06-03: New Branding, LLM vs PKM, & improved keyboard control
Buttons needs a new maintainer, there's a new TTRPG community vault, & Tasks continues with fast-paced updates.

## Obsidian Updates

* Obsidian has a new [logo](https://obsidian.md/blog/new-obsidian-icon/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), a new [website design](https://obsidian.md/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), a new [changelog](https://obsidian.md/changelog?ref=eleanorkonik.com), and a new [blog](https://obsidian.md/blog/?ref=eleanorkonik.com). The figma files for the new logo are located [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1246118009912598137?ref=eleanorkonik.com).
